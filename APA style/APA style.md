# APA Guidelines for Using Numbers in Writing

Do not begin a sentence with a number

Spell out numbers below 10

Use numerals to express numbers 10 and above

Use words to spell out common fractions (e.g., two-thirds), universally accepted proper nouns (e.g., Twelve Apostles), or numbers that begin a sentence, title, or section heading

Use numerals to express numbers that precede a unit of measurement (e.g., 12 cm), or represent times, dates, ages, scores, or statistical/mathematical functions (e.g., 5% of the sample, 12:30 a.m., 2-year-olds, etc.)

# General guidelines
Your paper must typewritten, double-spaced, have one-inch margins, use the Times New Roman font, use headings, page numbers and page headers on every page

Your writing assignment must be printed on standard size paper that is eight and a half by eleven, single sided only

It is recommended, for ease of reading comprehension, that you include two spaces after a period

# Title Page
The title page must have the title centered at the top of the page. The title must be a concise statement of the title of your paper. 

On the next line, your author’s name, preferably first name, middle initials, and last name, centered and it must be double spaced below the title. 

Next is the name of the course.

On the next line, your instructor’s title. 

The following line is for the date the paper was written, a running head designation, and a running head. 

The running head designation is simply "Running head" followed by a colon, and then an abbreviated version of your title with no more than fifty characters in all caps. The running head resides in the upper left-hand corner of the title page, flush left. "Running head:" is only stated on page one. The heading for all pages after page one is the abbreviated title of your paper in all caps. 

Lastly, the page number. Page numbering begins with one title page located on the upper right hand corner flush right.

# Abstract Page
Notice that the top left hand of the page contains the title of the paper in all caps. The page number is on the right. The title abstract is centered on the first line. The first line of the paragraph is not indented. 

Your abstract should be one hundred fifty to two-hundred and fifty words, double spaced. The abstract needs to be a brief comprehensive summary of the paper, but it is not an introduction to the paper. The abstract is one of the few places your paper does not contain citations.

# Body
The body of the document. This page is number three and know that it should be the case when writing a paper. 

The title of the page is centered at the top of the page. All the text on this page is double spaced with all sections following each other without a break. 

There are five levels of headings that you may use in your paper to make it easy to navigate.

If you choose to use tables and figures, they are formatted within the body of your document. Label tables and figures with an Arabic numeral and provide a title. For a table, the label and title should appear on separate lines above the table, flush-left, and single spaced. 

Cite a source in a note below the table.

For a figure, the label and title should appear on the same line below the figure, flush left, and single-spaced. 

Site the source below the label and the title.
